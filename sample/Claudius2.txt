H 3
Bitten on thy ass, sympathies extend if not for circumstance.
Nature bent, divine hammer worked from twisted to pristine
Sent you, hag, to these grounds
C 2
A corse is a corse, both poisoned.
Scoff, yes, scoff, but here is your home. 
H 2
Yes, corse is a corse, of course, hath yours done in victory?
Accursed dirt, yet fairness in the trade
C 3
Lowered thy down to hell, 
Time with crown paid with time expelled.
What gained hath thy?
H 1
Spite, old man, gained satisfaction.
