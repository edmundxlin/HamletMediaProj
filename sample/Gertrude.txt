H 2
Ho Mother! I could not bear it any longer. The rage of my fathers death, your husband, came upon me. 
I had to do it. He told me to spare you and I was clouded by my anger. 
G 1
Hamlet, my sweet boy. Have you gone mad again? What did you do.
H 3
I killed mine Uncle, who had poisoned my father much like how you were poisoned. 
He was a sinful, greedy man who did not deserve your love. I don’t believe you even loved my father 
even a quarter of how he loved you. Did you mother? Or did you do it just for the crown and the pleasure.
G 4
Hamlet, stop it! Your foul mouth hath gone too far. Of course I loved your father. 
However, I loved Claudius just as dearly. Had I known that he caused your fathers death, I would have never loved him. 
But now, his blood is in your hands. You have fulfilled your father’s supposed wish and I wish you eternal peace. 
Now go rest my dear Hamlet, you have suffered long enough.  
H 4
Perhaps his blood is in my hands but his heart is still yours. I love your mother but I regret to 
inform you that I can’t ever rest in peace again. Knowing that you allowed this incestuous relation and 
loved him in the same sheets not two months ago where you loved my father, I can no longer remain in peace. 
Farwell Mother, may God lead you on the right path in the afterlife, a life without whorish behaviours.
