H 4
That sexton hath dig my grave, as he hath dig the graves for the damned. 
To what base doth I fall.
‘Twas not a distant time alas, 
when above I stood, 
H 4
yet I step foot here ‘gain and lie’st in here.
I am indifferent to those here,
To the lawyer and his great cases, his witty words,
And to the landlord, conquered lands in fist, 
H 4
As, perchance, neither hath none more than the final bed of rest, 
And e’en so, mine bones giveth away lesser than they.
How long ‘twas it a man will lie i’th’ earth ere he rot?
Some eight or nine year?
H 4
Time undoes me. Is another fellow meant to unearth the dirt here,
And i’th’ process, strike and jowl mine own skull, as this one has? 
Or will dust doth I returneth to, 
And be scattered in winds, as with Alexander and Caesar, 
H 3
But the common peasant as well?
Oh Horatio, your judgement be not incorrect for most,
But this once, I fear thou’st been nearsighted.
