H 4
I hope thy soul can see rest now
After the revenge I hath given thee.
I hath slain thy murderer. The beast who
Preyed on thy queen.
K 3
Ay. That man of filth and guile, that I once called a brother
Hath been put in his place. Discharge his body to torture and fry for he hath committ’d the vilest sins.
Thous’t remember’d thy oath. Thou art a rightful son.
H 1
Ay, yet I sense imperfect.
K 2
Endure not from thy past business. Let it not tarnish thy virtue or wit. Thou art a proper son. Thou hast avenged thy father.
Thou hast mend the ill.
H 2
Ay, seem it be. I look for mine place now. 
I won’t lose thee, father.
