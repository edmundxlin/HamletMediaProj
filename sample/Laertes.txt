H 1
Alas, we meeteth again.
L 1
Noble Hamlet, has thee rememb’r’d mine own bleeding voice?
H 2
Ay. I doth forgive thee as thoust has’t f’r me. 
Prithee we rest i‘th sliver of peace this hath provides us.
L 1
So shall we hope. Let us wander not the tormenting flames, but the sweet heavens.
H 2
Sooth, we art more similar less different more similar. 
Gentle Danes of generosity, both charg’d to the vengence of our father’s unnatural passing.
L 1
O! What doth thous’t mean? T’was not thy father by a serpent stung?
H 4
Nay, how foul a death had he. Venom’d by mine uncle. 
The vile villain who, by thee, poison’d mine chalice. 
Withal, he hath to England bade me and, with knavish intent, 
called for mine murder upon’t.
L 3
O profane murderer! What a crook’d creature! Abus’d mine appetite for vengeance, 
for his lawless gain? T’was he the root of thy madness? 
A caitiff, so lacking of grace and virtue! Unapt he to be king.
H 2
Verily. Let that incestuous satyr be confin’d to walk 
the in the sulphur of day, his spirt forever purge his sins.
L 1
O Hamlet, had I known of his vile conceptions.
H 2
Dread not. Of his purpose thou had no wisdom. 
He was rotten, thou art noble, Laetres. Farewell and rest you merry.
L 1
Farewell Hamlet.
