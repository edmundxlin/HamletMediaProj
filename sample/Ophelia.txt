H 4
Doubt thou the stars are fire,
Doubt that the sun doth move,
Doubt truth to be a liar,
But never doubt I love.
H 4
O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers.
I have not art to reckon my groans, but that I love thee best, oh, most best, believe it. Adieu.
Thine evermore, most dear lady,
whilst this machine is to him,
O 1
Ah, mine lord. 't’s thee. I’m afraid I cannot accept thy love.
H 3
I knoweth thy fath'r f'rbid our loveth, as didst thy broth'r.  
But mine own sweet Ophelia, I has't been unkind to thee. 
But the again, thou did spy on me. 
O 3
I only spied because my father and your Uncle hath told me to, and I must obeyed. 
You told me I was a breeder of sinners. You told me to go to a nunnery. You told 
me that you lied, that you didn’t love me. Your madness hath droven me to madness. 
H 4
And I told you that I loved. And I, have always loved you. I never stopped. 
I simply had to convince everyone else I was mad, and that included you. 
When you died, I was in hysterics. Your brother watched me go to utter lengths, 
so much so as to jump into your grave with you. 
O 1
You did? 
H 2
Indeed my love. I had to avenge my father’s death. Had he still been alive, 
we would have been together. For my most indecent and crude behaviour, I am here to give my utter most apologizes. 
O 1
Oh Hamlet! Yo u really have gone mad from mine beauty! If only we had more time. 
H 2
Indeed, if only. Tis too late now. I just wanted you to know that 
I love you and came to ask for your forgiveness. 
O 1
My lord, your love and forgiveness I accept. 
H 1
Farewell, my most ever fair lady. Heaven will be waiting for you.
