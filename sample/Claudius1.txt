H 4
Filth to himself seems so high in his speech.
Upon’t— speak old man— lend thy reasoning,
How’t produc’d sea and land, famin’d land and bountiful sea,
Materials and immaterials us’d whose name common?
C 2
Cousin Hamlet, thy nature vengeful still?
A mirror’d form I will lend thus— seek’t thyself.
H 4
Pray to’t. 
Pray, pray, pray, my name thy kneel with.
Utter’t, moreso deaf He grows.
High estate gain’d through foul enterprise;
H 2
Coin taken now cast to beggar.
Kneel, I pray, on soil thief and thieved share.
