H 4
Fools! Thou has’t, less a thought,
Set apart our friendship, for a hipped king.
Elect’d file o’er league?
Alas, thou has’t brought thy fate upon yourself.
D 3
My lord, we import’d no ill intent for you.
T’was the king and queen. Thou surely know
What befalls those who revolt.
R 1
Ay! One who faces the king, will be sent to the grave .
H 4
Forsooth, thou has’t been infixed in the bout of might opposites.
Like a couplement of ants, wandering a wasps nest.
O, but thou art fools, failing of the onset.
Foolish and unpractised. 
H 3
And thous’t wittingly false thy friend.
Thus, thou answer thy fortune:
The fools are fool’d.
D 1
Ay, of our job we let fall, and of you, we let fall. Prithee thee think upon’st less as fiends and more as brothers.
R 1
More as brothers, less as fools.
